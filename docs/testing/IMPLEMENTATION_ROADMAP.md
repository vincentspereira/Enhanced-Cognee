## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Infrastructure Complexity
**Risk Level**: High
**Impact**: Delays in testing infrastructure setup
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Use infrastructure-as-code for reproducible environments
- Implement automated infrastructure provisioning
- Have backup infrastructure providers
- Create detailed infrastructure documentation

**Contingency Plan**:
- Simplified testing environment with core components only
- Cloud-based testing infrastructure as fallback
- Manual infrastructure setup procedures
- Extended timeline for infrastructure setup

#### Risk 2: Performance Testing Scale
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Impact**: Inability to achieve enterprise-scale testing
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement distributed load generation
- Use cloud-based load testing services
- Create scalable testing architecture
- Monitor resource utilization closely

**Contingency Plan**:
- Scaled-down testing with performance extrapolation
- Phased performance testing approach
- Alternative load testing tools
- Extended performance testing timeline

#### Risk 3: Tool Integration Complexity
**Risk Level**: Medium
